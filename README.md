This colab file allows an interactive parsing of the underlying logic and pipeline of the approach.


ORACLE is a WT-agnostic, Walsh-Hadamard based framework that can treats phenotype-genotype datasets using a CDMS (combinatorial deep mutational scanning) approach with interpretable epistasis modelling to generate 1st order, 2nd order, 3rd order and higher order of epistasis coefficients. With this coefficients, we can quantify protein interaction landscapes and show interactions that can be explained with single mutations (1st order) and interactions that rely on cumulative, additive interactions of amino acids. Using these epistasis coefficients can also help to predict out of sample phenotypes for missing or unsampled variants, with high degrees of confidence with as sparse as 1% of the fitness landscape. This approach expands on the exisiting Walsh-Hadamard matrices, but are now configured to be wild-type free without need for referencing to a particular backround, and is able to analytically generate all mutational paths involved in a statistical epistasis calculation to explain the contributions leading to a wild-type independent epistasis coefficient value. 

## ORACLE Epistasis Code Installation & Usage Guide


ORACLE epistasis can also be run locally using the following pip installation guide

# 
This guide details how to install the ORACLE package locally for development and analysis.

## Prerequisites
* **Python >= 3.8+** 

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, download the code to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Creixell-lab/ORACLE.git
cd ORACLE
```

### 2. Create environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv # or any other environment name
```

### 3. Activate environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -e .
```

### 5. Verify installation

```bash
oracle-epistasis --help
```

### 6. Run Example

```bash
oracle-epistasis \
  --input "example_files/210825_PIN1_36_library.csv" \
  --outdir "./oracle_output" \
  --variant-col pep_encoded \
  --phenotype-col PD_input_mean \
  --n 6 --k 3 --max-order 3 \
  --alphabet a,b,c
```

### Usage Guide

**Input Parameters:**

* `--input`: Path to the input `.csv` file (can be tab or comma delimited).
* `--outdir`: Path to the directory where output files will be saved.
* `--variant-col`: Column name containing the variant sequences (genotypes). These can be encoded or actual amino acids.
* `--phenotype-col`: Column name containing the experimental or computational phenotype measurement.
* `--n`: The length of the sequence (number of positions).
* `--k`: The size of the alphabet (number of possible amino acids/characters per position).
* `--max-order`: The maximum order of epistasis interactions to include in the model.
* `--alphabet`: A comma-separated list of characters used in the genotypes (e.g., `a,b,c` or `A,C,D,E...`).

**Output Files:**

The script generates two files in the specified output directory:

1.  `predicted.csv`: Contains the predicted phenotypes calculated by adding epistatic terms from the 1st order up to the specified `max-order`.
2.  `epistasis_terms.csv`: Contains the calculated coefficients (weights) for the epistatic terms used in the model.
